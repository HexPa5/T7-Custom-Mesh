# T7-Custom-Mesh
NOTICE! This is source code of Dragon_Paul and CrossS95 decompiled in JetBrains Dotpeek (special thanks for AStronomy!)
YT Link for binary - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWY9DjcJgl0
The source include all resources and code work as well but there's only one issue with .Xaml window file of "SystemShadowDropChrome"
The main goal of distribute is modify it for other Unreal 3/4 games and it's package files (Also you can download it and work alone if you want)
This code needs .NET Framework 4.6/4.6.1 and VS 17/19

Happy Modding!
